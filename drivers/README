Gertboard test/example software

Type "make all" to compile all the examples. Each program will print
out a description of what connections need to be made on the Gertboard
to run them.

Two of the files, minirc.ama0 and LEDmeter.ino, are used for
programming the ATmega microprocessor on the Gertboard.
